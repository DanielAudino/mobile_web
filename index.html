					<p>The mission of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
					and Development (OECD) is to promote policies that will improve
					the economic and social well-being of people around the world.
					</p>
					<p>The OECD provides a forum in which governments can work 
						together to share experiences and seek solutions to common
						problems. We work with governments to understand what drives
						economic, social and environmental change. We measure productivity 
						and global flows of trade and investment. We analyse and compare data 
						to predict future trends. We set international standards on a wide range 
						of things, from agriculture and tax to the safety of chemicals.
					</p>
					<p>We look, too, at issues that directly affect the lives of ordinary 
						people, like how much they pay in taxes and social security, and how much 
						leisure time they can take. We compare how different countries’ school systems 
						are readying their young people for modern life, and how different countries’ 
						pension systems will look after their citizens in old age.
					</p>
					<p>Drawing on facts and real-life experience, we recommend policies designed to make 
						the lives of ordinary people better. We work with business, through the Business and
						Industry Advisory Committee to the OECD, and with labour, through the Trade Union Advisory 
						Committee. We have active contacts as well with other civil society organisations. The common 
						thread of our work is a shared commitment to market economies backed by democratic institutions
						and focused on the wellbeing of all citizens. Along the way, we also set out to make life harder 
						for the terrorists, tax dodgers, crooked businessmen and others whose actions undermine a fair and
						open society.
